There’s no place for users/devs to talk about local agent/AI identity and permissions across projects

# Local Agent Identity & Permissions: Open Discussion

Welcome! This repo is a public rally point for anyone interested in building (or needing) a unified, open-source way for local AI/automation agents and apps to:
- Share identity
- Manage permissions and access
- Work securely together, across projects and stacks

**Why this repo?**
- Right now, there’s no easy, cross-project way for local agents/apps to know “who you are” or “what you’re allowed to do.”
- Projects like [Cline](https://cline.bot), [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/spec), Vaultwarden, LM Studio, and others are paving the way—but there’s no central place for users, devs, and maintainers to talk about this problem, share needs, or co-design a solution.

**What to do here:**
- Add issues or discussion topics: problems, feature requests, links to other projects, even “I want this too!”
- Use the Discussions tab to share workflows, pain points, or designs.
- If you’re already building something similar, link it here!

**Who’s welcome?**
- Everyone: users, developers, sysadmins, AI tinkerers, privacy advocates. No coding skills needed to participate.

**Related Projects:**
- [Cline](https://cline.bot)
- [MCP Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/spec)
- [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)


Let’s figure out what’s needed and how to get there—together.
