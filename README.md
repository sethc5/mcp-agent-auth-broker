# Local Agent Identity & Permissions: Open Discussion

Welcome! This repo is a public rally point for anyone interested in building (or needing) a unified, open-source way for local AI/automation agents and apps to:
- Share identity
- Manage permissions and access
- Work securely together, across projects and stacks

---

## What's In Scope?
- *Any* open-source project, tool, or agent that could benefit from unified local identity/permissions/authentication.
- Ways to connect agents, LLMs, and automation tools securely, across projects.
- Collaboration/ideas with Cline, MCP, Vaultwarden, LM Studio, Home Assistant, agent frameworks, and others.

---

## Example Use Cases
- “I want my LM Studio agent to safely run scripts on my machine, but only after getting my approval.”
- “I wish Cline and Vaultwarden could handshake so I can use the same login for both.”
- “I run multiple agent apps—can I approve or revoke access from one place?”
- “How can I prevent rogue agents from accessing private files, even locally?”

---

## Key Open Questions
- What should an “identity” mean for a local agent?
- What is the minimal “permission broker” that’s actually useful?
- Should we adapt OAuth/OIDC, build something new, or extend tools like Vaultwarden?
- What’s the best way for projects to plug in—API, daemon, file, bus, or...?

---

## How to Get Involved
- Post a pain point or scenario in Discussions.
- Share links to related standards, plugins, or repos.
- Offer feedback, use-cases, or “what if…” ideas.
- Volunteer to prototype, document, or test.
